# Doxyfile 1.8.11
#
# This file contains all non-default values for the doxygen configuration. The
# documentation of all configuration entries is taken from the doxygen skeleton
# configuration file.

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.
PROJECT_NAME = "@PROJECT_NAME@"

# The PROJECT_NUMBER tag can be used to enter a project or revision number. This
# could be handy for archiving the generated documentation or if some version
# control system is used.
PROJECT_NUMBER = "@PROJECT_VERSION@"

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started. This tag
# requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.
STRIP_FROM_PATH = @PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@

# Set the OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C tag to YES if your project consists of C sources
# only. Doxygen will then generate output that is more tailored for C. For
# instance, some of the names that are used will be different. The list of all
# members will be omitted, etc.
# The default value is: NO.
OPTIMIZE_OUTPUT_FOR_C = YES

# If the EXTRACT_ALL tag is set to YES, doxygen will assume all entities in
# documentation are documented, even if no documentation was available. Private
# class members and static file members will be hidden unless the
# EXTRACT_PRIVATE respectively EXTRACT_STATIC tags are set to YES.
# Note: This will also disable the warnings about undocumented members that are
# normally produced when WARNINGS is set to YES.
# The default value is: NO.
EXTRACT_ALL = YES

# If the EXTRACT_PRIVATE tag is set to YES, all private members of a class will
# be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.
EXTRACT_PRIVATE = @DOXYGEN_DOC_INTERNAL@

# If the EXTRACT_STATIC tag is set to YES, all static members of a file will be
# included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.
EXTRACT_STATIC = @DOXYGEN_DOC_INTERNAL@

# The INTERNAL_DOCS tag determines if documentation that is typed after a
# \internal command is included. If the tag is set to NO then the documentation
# will be excluded. Set it to YES to include the internal documentation.
# The default value is: NO.
INTERNAL_DOCS = @DOXYGEN_DOC_INTERNAL@

# The QUIET tag can be used to turn on/off the messages that are generated to
# standard output by doxygen. If QUIET is set to YES this implies that the
# messages are off.
# The default value is: NO.
QUIET = YES

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.
INPUT = @PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR@/src

# The RECURSIVE tag can be used to specify whether or not subdirectories should
# be searched for input files as well.
# The default value is: NO.
RECURSIVE = YES

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.
GENERATE_LATEX = NO

# If the GENERATE_MAN tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate man pages for
# classes and files.
# The default value is: NO.
GENERATE_MAN = YES

# If you set the HAVE_DOT tag to YES then doxygen will assume the dot tool is
# available from the path. This tool is part of Graphviz (see:
# http://www.graphviz.org/), a graph visualization toolkit from AT&T and Lucent
# Bell Labs. The other options in this section have no effect if this option is
# set to NO
# The default value is: NO.
HAVE_DOT = @DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND@

# If the INCLUDED_BY_GRAPH, ENABLE_PREPROCESSING and SEARCH_INCLUDES tags are
# set to YES then doxygen will generate a graph for each documented file showing
# the direct and indirect include dependencies of the file with other documented
# files.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.
INCLUDED_BY_GRAPH = NO

# If the CALL_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a call
# dependency graph for every global function or class method.
#
# Note that enabling this option will significantly increase the time of a run.
# So in most cases it will be better to enable call graphs for selected
# functions only using the \callgraph command. Disabling a call graph can be
# accomplished by means of the command \hidecallgraph.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.
CALL_GRAPH = YES

# If the CALLER_GRAPH tag is set to YES then doxygen will generate a caller
# dependency graph for every global function or class method.
#
# Note that enabling this option will significantly increase the time of a run.
# So in most cases it will be better to enable caller graphs for selected
# functions only using the \callergraph command. Disabling a caller graph can be
# accomplished by means of the command \hidecallergraph.
# The default value is: NO.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.
CALLER_GRAPH = YES

# The DOT_PATH tag can be used to specify the path where the dot tool can be
# found. If left blank, it is assumed the dot tool can be found in the path.
# This tag requires that the tag HAVE_DOT is set to YES.
DOT_PATH = @DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE@
